1 tablespoon olive oil or canola oil
1 large onion, chopped (2 cups)
2 stalks celery, chopped (1/2 cup)
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ cup pearled barley, rinsed
1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth
1 pound bone-in chicken breast or thighs
4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks (2 cups)
2 large parsnips, cored, peeled, and cut into 1-inch chunks (2 cups)
¼ cup chopped fresh dill or 1 Tbsp. dried
3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground pepper

Step 1
Heat oil in a multicooker using the Saute setting. Add onion and celery; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
 (Adjust temperature as necessary by pressing the Saute button for more or less heat.) Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. 
Add barley and stir to coat. Add broth, chicken, carrots, and parsnips.

Step 2
Lock the lid in place and twist the steam-release handle to the sealed position. 
Select Pressure Cook/High for 8 minutes (or follow manufacturer's directions to pressure-cook for 8 minutes).

Step 3
When pressure-cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. Release the remaining pressure manually. 
Check for doneness: an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken should register at least 165F and the barley and vegetables should be tender. 
(If necessary, switch to the Saute setting and cook until everything is done.)

Step 4
Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board. When it is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones. 
Shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces; return to the soup and heat through using the Saute setting, if necessary. Stir in dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. 
Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.
