    <h1>Desi Style Crispy Chicken Fried Rice (35 min)</h1>
    <i>This Fried Rice that is fragrant with the aroma of Garlic is very easy to make and can be made very quickly. 
    Here is a detailed Recipe with images and a video. Indo-Chinese recipes are very quick to make and they make for very good party dishes. 
    This Burnt Garlic Fried Rice tastes great with Tomato Ketchup or Indo-Chinese Starters</i>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    Garlic
    1. The Fried Rice tastes great if the chopped Garlic is fried well but do not let the Garlic burn as the Rice becomes bitter.
    Basmati Rice:
    2. I have used Basmati Rice but you could use any other rice as well.

    <h2>How to make Rice fluffy:</h2>
    3. Soak Rice for 30 minutes. Add 4 cups of Water, Salt and Oil and cook to 80% on a high flame.
    4. Cooking Rice to 80% means when you break a grain, it should still be a little solid.
    At that stage, strain the Rice and spread it on a plate coated with Oil or in a sieve and let it cool down fully. 
    Then you get fluffy, non-sticky Rice.

    <h2>Aromatic powder :</h2>
    1. I have used Aromatic powder found in the market instead of Ajinomoto. 
    This is a substitute for Ajinomoto. 
    In case you like Ajinomoto, you could use it or go without it
